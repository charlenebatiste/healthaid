## General Info
I created this project to learn how to develop mobile apps. I was also interested in learning new technologies so instead of building an Ionic React app I decided to build and Ionic Angular app and use SCSS for styling, rather than CSS.

## User Stories
1. As a User I want to have an application that can remind me when I am supposed to take my medication.
2. As a User I want this application to keep track of which medications I have taken or missed for the benefit of any future diagnosis.
3. As a User I want this app to store all medications, dosages and notes in a single location for easy access.

## Process Work

1. Installed angular and ionic and set up development environement.
2. Delved into Ionic documentation to develop basic understanding of framework set up.
3. Setup a wireframe for the main page and applimented a simple layout, researching as needed.
